All programs are examples of how to use inheritance in C++.
All programs are original, including the names of the writers and date elaborated

AguilarRosa4OOPPillars
This code includes examples of the 4 pillars of object oriented programming, including abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It includes an abstract class, two abstract classes that inherit from the abstract class, and four more classes, two of which inherit from one class that inherit from the abstract class and the other two inherit from the other. Each of the non abstract “parent classes” include 5 attributes, 2 methods, and a method for polymorphism whereas their “child classes” include 2 attributes, 2 methods, and an application of the parent class method for polymorphism. All of them include getters, setters, and constructors. There is also a method that is not part of any class that interacts with one of the child classes.

AguilarRosaTest2 
This program includes code that relates to classes that inherit from multiple classes. The code includes 2 parent classes with their own methods and attributes and 2 child classes. Both parent classes have a method that shares a name but different functions. One of the child classes has a method that accesses the functions with the same name at the same time whereas the other child class accesses the parent functions separately, avoiding a conflict of ambiguety.

AguilarRosaTest2 
This program includes code that combines several aspects of inheritance seen in the previous 2 codes. it includes an abstract class, two classes that inherit from the abstract class, each with two child classes. There is also a separate class that inherits from several classes at the same time. Each class has their own parameterized constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor that prints onto the terminal the destruction of the object,. 

ThisMain, Shape, SquareShape, and RoundShape
These programs are all related and involve inheritance across header files. There is a parent class with 4 attributes, a parameterized constructor, destructor, getters, setters, and two methods, two child classes that inherit from the parent class that also have the aforementioned traits of the parent class, and all are saved as header (.h) files. ThisMain is the main .cpp file that invokes the .h files, and it has defined constants that interact with the objects created from the classes.
